A working MariaDB database is required to run this project. The database connection information should be provided in a `config.properties` file. It should already be initialized with an empty `corpus` database before running.

`config.properties` should be located in the root of the project before running. It should be based of the provided `config.properties.example` file in the root of the project.

A similar thing has to be done for the `.env.example` file. It should be renamed to `.env` and the values should be filled in.
